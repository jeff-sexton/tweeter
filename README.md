# Tweeter Project

Tweeter is a simple, single-page Twitter clone.

This repository is the completed project based on starter code from Lighthouse Labs. The student work is primarily all of the front end HTML, CSS, JS, jQuery and AJAX. The backend server is largely unchanged from the starter code.

The project is implemented to be responsive to screen width and has a number of UI features to impove user experience.
